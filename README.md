For my assignment on inheritance, I developed a Java application comprising three primary classes, adhering closely to the guidelines provided. The core class, UseDinnerParty, encapsulates the main functionality, orchestrating the creation, configuration, and event handling within the graphical user interface (GUI). Accompanying it are two additional classes: Party and Dinner Party. The Party class encapsulates the functionality to manage the number of guests through private variables and corresponding getter and setter methods. Building upon this, the Dinner Party class inherits from Party, introducing mechanisms to manage dinner selections with similar accessor methods.

In a bid to enhance the user experience and introduce a touch of creativity, I opted for radio buttons over traditional text boxes for meal selection. This choice was motivated by the intuitive nature of radio buttons, which naturally restrict the user to a single selection, aligning perfectly with the context of choosing a dinner option. Moreover, to ensure a smooth user journey, I implemented an error-handling feature where, if a dinner selection is not made but the user attempts to proceed by clicking "Continue," an error message promptly appears, advising, "Please Select a dinner option."

In summary, my project not only fulfills the requirements of utilizing inheritance principles but also introduces thoughtful, user-friendly enhancements to the GUI, underscoring my commitment to both functionality and creative design.
